# Next.js Boilerplate

A clean and scalable **Next.js boilerplate** that helps you start projects faster without worrying about setup or messy folder structures.  
The main idea is simple: focus on building features, not re-inventing the structure every single time.  

---

## Philosophy

Building apps should be about **creating features**, not about deciding where to put files or how to name them every single time.  
This boilerplate exists to:  

- Remove repetitive setup steps  
- Keep every project consistent  
- Make it easier to maintain and scale over time

---

## Why use this boilerplate?

- **Consistency out of the box** → All projects follow the same clean structure.  
- **Scalable architecture** → Works well for both small apps and larger, more complex ones.  
- **Separation of concerns** → Client and server logic are clearly separated.  
- **Faster project setup** → No need to think about where to put files or how to name them.  
- **Future-proof** → Designed to be reused across all upcoming Next.js projects.
